# Maria's SQL Portfolio
Welcome to my SQL portfolio! My name is Maria Myers, and I’m a beginner data analyst with a degree in Information Systems (with a track in Business). I’m currently working through the BreakIntoTech Data Analyst Certification. This repository showcases the SQL projects and exercises I’ve completed as part of my certification journey. While I’m still building my skills, these projects highlight my progress in learning to analyze data, create queries, and work with databases.

### In this portfolio, you’ll find:

- SQL query basics: Examples of SELECT statements, JOINs, aggregations, and basic subqueries, demonstrating my growing understanding of SQL.
- Simple database design: Projects where I’ve built basic database schemas and established relationships between tables.
- Data analysis: Early hands-on experience analyzing datasets and drawing insights to answer business questions.
- Query optimization: Initial efforts at improving query performance and working with larger datasets more efficiently.

As I continue to work through the certification, I’m excited to expand my skills and tackle more complex data analysis challenges. Feel free to explore my projects, offer feedback, or reach out if you’d like to collaborate or discuss any of the work!
