# Maria's SQL Portfolio </br>
ðŸŒŠWelcome to my SQL portfolio!ðŸŒŠ </br>
My name is Maria Myers, and Iâ€™m a beginner data analyst with a degree in Information Systems (with a track in Business). Iâ€™m currently working through the BreakIntoTech Data Analyst Certification. This repository showcases the SQL projects and exercises Iâ€™ve completed as part of my certification journey. While Iâ€™m still building my skills, these projects highlight my progress in learning to analyze data, create queries, and work with databases. </br>

### In this portfolio, youâ€™ll find: </br>

- SQL query basics: Examples of SELECT statements, JOINs, aggregations, and basic subqueries, demonstrating my growing understanding of SQL. </br>
- Simple database design: Projects where Iâ€™ve built basic database schemas and established relationships between tables. </br>
- Data analysis: Early hands-on experience analyzing datasets and drawing insights to answer business questions. </br>
- Query optimization: Initial efforts at improving query performance and working with larger datasets more efficiently. </br>

As I continue to work through the certification, Iâ€™m excited to expand my skills and tackle more complex data analysis challenges. Feel free to explore my projects, offer feedback, or reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or discuss any of the work! </br>
