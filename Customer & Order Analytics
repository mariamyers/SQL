-- In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-- 1. How many orders were placed in January?
-- filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs 
--9681

-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
-- 379
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID = BIT_DB.customers.order_id

WHERE length(orderid) = 6

-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
-- AAA batteries (4-pack) for $2.99

-- (Revenue = number of products sold and the price of the products)
SELECT product, 
	SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue --There are lots of duplicates of the product names, because different order IDs ordered the same product in many cases. Now there's only one of each product listed, with the price of that product and the total quantity of each that were sold
